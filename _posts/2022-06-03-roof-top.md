## Problem Statement - [*link*](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/roof-top-1587115621/1/#)  

You are given heights of consecutive buildings. You can move from the roof of a building to the roof of next adjacent building. You need to find the maximum number of consecutive steps you can put forward such that you gain an increase in altitude with each step.

**Your Task:** 
The task is to complete the function `maxStep()` which takes an array `A[]` (denoting the heights of buildings) and its size `N` as inputs and returns the maximum number of steps to gain increase in altitude.

**Expected Time Complexity:** `O(N)`  
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** `O(1)`

### Examples

**Example 1:**   
```
Input:
N = 5
A[] = {1,2,2,3,2}
Output: 1
Explanation: 1, 2 or 2, 3 are the only consecutive 
buildings with increasing heights thus maximum number
of consecutive steps with increase in gain in altitude
would be 1 in both cases.

```

**Example 2:**   
```
Input:
N = 4
A[] = {1,2,3,4}
Output: 3
Explanation: 1 to 2 to 3 to 4 is the jump of
length 3 to have maximum number of 
buildings with increasing heights, so maximum steps
with increasing altitude becomes 3.
```

### Constraints

+ `1 <= N <= 10^6`
+ `1 <= arrray[i] = 10^5`

## Solutions

```cpp
class Solution{
    public:
    //Function to find maximum number of consecutive steps 
    //to gain an increase in altitude with each step.
    int maxStep(int A[], int N)
    {
       //Your code here
        int max_steps = 0, steps = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i < N; i++){
            if(A[i] > A[i-1]){
                steps++;
                max_steps = max(max_steps, steps);
            }
            else{
                steps = 0;
            }
        }
        return max_steps;
    }
};
```
