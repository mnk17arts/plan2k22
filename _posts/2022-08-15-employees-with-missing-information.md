## Problem Statement - [*link*](https://leetcode.com/problems/employees-with-missing-information/)  

**SQL Schema** 
```sql
Create table If Not Exists Employees (employee_id int, name varchar(30))
Create table If Not Exists Salaries (employee_id int, salary int)
Truncate table Employees
insert into Employees (employee_id, name) values ('2', 'Crew')
insert into Employees (employee_id, name) values ('4', 'Haven')
insert into Employees (employee_id, name) values ('5', 'Kristian')
Truncate table Salaries
insert into Salaries (employee_id, salary) values ('5', '76071')
insert into Salaries (employee_id, salary) values ('1', '22517')
insert into Salaries (employee_id, salary) values ('4', '63539')
```

Table: `Employees`

```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| employee_id | int     |
| name        | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
employee_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the name of the employee whose ID is employee_id.
```

Table: `Salaries`

```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| employee_id | int     |
| salary      | int     |
+-------------+---------+
employee_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the salary of the employee whose ID is employee_id.
```


**Your Task:** 

Write an SQL query to report the IDs of all the employees with missing information. The information of an employee is missing if:

+ The employee's name is missing, or
+ The employee's salary is missing.

Return the result table ordered by employee_id in ascending order.

The query result format is in the following example.


### Example
   
```
Input: 
Employees table:
+-------------+----------+
| employee_id | name     |
+-------------+----------+
| 2           | Crew     |
| 4           | Haven    |
| 5           | Kristian |
+-------------+----------+
Salaries table:
+-------------+--------+
| employee_id | salary |
+-------------+--------+
| 5           | 76071  |
| 1           | 22517  |
| 4           | 63539  |
+-------------+--------+
Output: 
+-------------+
| employee_id |
+-------------+
| 1           |
| 2           |
+-------------+
Explanation: 
Employees 1, 2, 4, and 5 are working at this company.
The name of employee 1 is missing.
The salary of employee 2 is missing.
```
