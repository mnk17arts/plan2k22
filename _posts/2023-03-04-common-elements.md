## Problem Statement - [_link_](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/common-elements1132/1)

Given three arrays sorted in increasing order. Find the elements that are common in all three arrays.
Note: can you take care of the duplicates without using any additional Data Structure?

**Your Task:**

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function commonElements() which take the 3 arrays A[], B[], C[] and their respective sizes n1, n2 and n3 as inputs and returns an array containing the common element present in all the 3 arrays in sorted order.

If there are no such elements return an empty array. In this case the output will be printed as -1.

**Expected Time Complexity:** `O(n1 + n2 + n3)`  
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** `O(n1 + n2 + n3)`

### Examples

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
n1 = 6; A = {1, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80}
n2 = 5; B = {6, 7, 20, 80, 100}
n3 = 8; C = {3, 4, 15, 20, 30, 70, 80, 120}
Output: 20 80
Explanation: 20 and 80 are the only
common elements in A, B and C.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:
n1 = 6; A = {1, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80}
n2 = 5; B = {6, 7, 20, 80, 100}
n3 = 8; C = {3, 4, 15, 20, 30, 70, 80, 120}
Output: 20 80
Explanation: 20 and 80 are the only
common elements in A, B and C.
```

### Constraints

- `1 â‰¤ n1 + n2 + n3  <= 10^5`
- the array elements can be both positive or negative integers.

## Solutions

```cpp

class Solution{
    public:
       vector<int> commonElements(int A[], int B[], int C[], int n1, int n2, int n3)
        {
            //code here.
            int i = 0, j = 0, k = 0;
            vector<int> res;
            int prev = INT_MIN;
            while(i < n1 && j < n2 && k < n3) {
                int a = A[i], b = B[j], c = C[k];
                if(a == b && a == c) {
                    if(prev != a) {
                        res.push_back(a);
                        prev = a;
                    }
                    i++, j++, k++;
                }
                else {
                    if(a <= b && a <= c) {
                        i++;
                    }
                    else if(b <= a && b <= c) {
                        j++;
                    }
                    else {
                        k++;
                    }
                }
            }
            return res;
        }
};

```
