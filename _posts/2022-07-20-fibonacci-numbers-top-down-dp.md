## Problem Statement - [*link*](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/batch-problems/fibonacci-numbers-top-down-dp/0/?track=DSASP-DP&batchId=154)  

One of the rudimentary problems to understand DP is finding the nth Fibonacci number. Here, we will solve the problem using the top-down approach.
You are given a number `N`. You need to find the `N`th Fibonacci number. The first two number of the series are `1` and `1`.

**Your Task:** 

You don't need to take any input. You have to complete the function `findNthFibonacci()` which takes single argument(number `N`) and returns the answer.


**Expected Time Complexity:** `O(N)`              
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** `O(N)`
Note: This space is used by dp array.


### Examples

**Example 1:**   
```
Input:
N = 5
Output: 5
```

**Example 2:**   
```
Input:
N = 7
Output: 13
Explanation: Some of the numbers of the
Fibonacci numbers are 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8,13
..... (N stars from 1).
```

### Constraints

+ `1 â‰¤ N <= 92`


## Solutions

```cpp
class Solution
{
    public:
    //Function to find the nth fibonacci number using top-down approach.
    long long findNthFibonacci(int number, long long int dp[])
    {
        // Your Code Here
        if(dp[number]==0)
            dp[number] = findNthFibonacci(number-1,dp)+findNthFibonacci(number-2,dp);
        return dp[number];
    }

};
```
