## Problem Statement - [_link_](https://leetcode.com/problems/successful-pairs-of-spells-and-potions/description/)

You are given two positive integer arrays spells and potions, of length n and m respectively, where spells[i] represents the strength of the ith spell and potions[j] represents the strength of the jth potion.

You are also given an integer success. A spell and potion pair is considered successful if the product of their strengths is at least success.

Return an integer array pairs of length n where pairs[i] is the number of potions that will form a successful pair with the ith spell.



### Examples

**Example 1:**  

```
Input: spells = [5,1,3], potions = [1,2,3,4,5], success = 7
Output: [4,0,3]
Explanation:
- 0th spell: 5 * [1,2,3,4,5] = [5,10,15,20,25]. 4 pairs are successful.
- 1st spell: 1 * [1,2,3,4,5] = [1,2,3,4,5]. 0 pairs are successful.
- 2nd spell: 3 * [1,2,3,4,5] = [3,6,9,12,15]. 3 pairs are successful.
Thus, [4,0,3] is returned.
```

**Example 2:**  

```
Input: spells = [3,1,2], potions = [8,5,8], success = 16
Output: [2,0,2]
Explanation:
- 0th spell: 3 * [8,5,8] = [24,15,24]. 2 pairs are successful.
- 1st spell: 1 * [8,5,8] = [8,5,8]. 0 pairs are successful. 
- 2nd spell: 2 * [8,5,8] = [16,10,16]. 2 pairs are successful. 
Thus, [2,0,2] is returned.
```



### Constraints

- `n == spells.length`
- `m == potions.length`
- `1 <= n, m <= 10^5`
- `1 <= spells[i], potions[j] <= 10^5`
- `1 <= success <= 10^10`


## Solutions

```cpp

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> successfulPairs(vector<int>& spells, vector<int>& potions, long long success) {
        sort(potions.begin(), potions.end());
        vector<int> res;
        for (int spell: spells) {
            long potion_needed = (success + spell - 1) / spell;
            auto it = lower_bound(potions.begin(), potions.end(), potion_needed);
            res.push_back(potions.end() - it);
        }
        return res;
    }
};

```
