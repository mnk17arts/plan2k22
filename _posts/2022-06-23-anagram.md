## Problem Statement - [*link*](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/anagram-1587115620/0/?track=DSASP-Strings&batchId=154#)  

Given two strings `a` and `b` consisting of lowercase characters. The task is to check whether two given strings are an anagram of each other or not. An anagram of a string is another string that contains the same characters, only the order of characters can be different. For example, act and tac are an anagram of each other.


**Your Task:** 
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function `isAnagram()` which takes the string `a` and string `b` as input parameter and check if the two strings are an anagram of each other. The function returns `true` if the strings are anagram else it returns `false`.


**Expected Time Complexity:** `O(|a|+|b|)`  
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** `O(Number of distinct characters)`

### Examples

**Example 1:**   
```
Input:a = geeksforgeeks, b = forgeeksgeeks
Output: YES
Explanation: Both the string have samecharacters with
        same frequency. So, both are anagrams.

```

**Example 2:**   
```
Input:a = allergy, b = allergic
Output: NO
Explanation:Characters in both the strings are 
        not same, so they are not anagrams.
```

### Constraints

+ `1 <= |a|, |b| <= 10^5`

## Solutions

```cpp
class Solution{
    public:
    //Function is to check whether two strings are anagram of each other or not.
    bool isAnagram(string a, string b){
        
        if(a.size() != b.size()) return false;
        // Your code here
        int c[26] = {0};
        for(int i=0; i<a.size(); i++){
            c[a[i]-'a']++;
            c[b[i]-'a']--;
        }
        for(int i=0 ; i<26; i++)
            if(c[i] > 0) return false;
        return true;
        
    }
};
```
