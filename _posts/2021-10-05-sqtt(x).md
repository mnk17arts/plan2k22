## Problem Statement - [*link*](https://leetcode.com/problems/sqrtx/)
Given a non-negative integer `x`, compute and return *the square root of `x`*.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are **truncated**, and only the **integer part** of the result is returned.

**Note**: You are not allowed to use any built-in exponent function or operator, such as `pow(x, 0.5)` or `x ** 0.5`

### Examples
**Example 1:**
```
Input: x = 4
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: x = 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.
```

### Constraints
+ `0 <= x <= 2^31 - 1`

## Solution
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int mySqrt(int x) {
        int l=0, r = x,mnk;
        long long mid;
        for(;l<=r;){
            mid = l + (r-l)/2;
            if(mid*mid <= x){
                mnk = mid;
                l=mid+1;
            }else{
                r=mid-1;
            }
        }
        return mnk;
    }
};
```
