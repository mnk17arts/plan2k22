## Problem Statement - [*link*](https://leetcode.com/problems/game-play-analysis-i/)  

**SQL Schema** 
```sql
Create table If Not Exists orders (order_number int, customer_number int)
Truncate table orders
insert into orders (order_number, customer_number) values ('1', '1')
insert into orders (order_number, customer_number) values ('2', '2')
insert into orders (order_number, customer_number) values ('3', '3')
insert into orders (order_number, customer_number) values ('4', '3')
```

**Table** : `Activity`

```
+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| player_id    | int     |
| device_id    | int     |
| event_date   | date    |
| games_played | int     |
+--------------+---------+
(player_id, event_date) is the primary key of this table.
This table shows the activity of players of some games.
Each row is a record of a player who logged in and played a number of games (possibly 0) before logging out on someday using some device.
```


**Your Task:** 

Write an SQL query to report the first login date for each player.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.


### Example
   
```
Input: 
Activity table:
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| player_id | device_id | event_date | games_played |
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-01 | 5            |
| 1         | 2         | 2016-05-02 | 6            |
| 2         | 3         | 2017-06-25 | 1            |
| 3         | 1         | 2016-03-02 | 0            |
| 3         | 4         | 2018-07-03 | 5            |
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
Output: 
+-----------+-------------+
| player_id | first_login |
+-----------+-------------+
| 1         | 2016-03-01  |
| 2         | 2017-06-25  |
| 3         | 2016-03-02  |
+-----------+-------------+
```


## Solutions

```sql

-- Write your T-SQL query statement below
select player_id, min(event_date) as "first_login" from activity
group by player_id;

```
