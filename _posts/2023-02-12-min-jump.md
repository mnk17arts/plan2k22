## Problem Statement - [*link*](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/contest/gfg-weekly-coding-contest-89/problems/)

Geek was playing in a playground and suddenly he encountered an array arr[] of length n written with positive integers and he wants you to calculate the minimum jump capacity he should have to reach the far end of the array with the condition that he only jump on Good indexes.

Any index i is said to be good if at least one of the following conditions for that index

+ arr[i]%2==0
+ arr[i]%3==0

Geek could jump to the right any distance from 1 to the value of this jump ability.

So your task is to return an integer representing the minimum jump ability of the geek that is needed to reach the last index, jumping only on good indexes.

Note:
+ 0 based indexing is used and geek is initially at index 0 and wants to reach index n-1.
+ Both )th and (n-1)th index are good indexes.

**Your Task:** 

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function `minJump()` which takes the array arr[] and its size n as input parameters and returns the minimum jump ability of the geek that is needed to reach the last index, jumping only on good indexes.


### Examples

**Example 1:**   
```
Input :
n=4
arr={2,1,3,6}
Output:
2
Explanation:
Indexes 0,2,3 are good indexes as they satisfy at 
least one condition. So we can jump from 0-->2-->3 
so the minimum jump capacity that geek should have is 2.
```

**Example 2:**   
```
Input :
n=4
arr={2,5,7,9}
Output:
3
Explanation:
0 and 3 are the only good indexes in the array 
so the only option is there is to jump from 
index 0 to index 3. Hence minimum jump 
capacity that geek should have is 3.
```

### Constraints

+ `2 ≤ Nn≤ 10^5`
+ `1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^5`

## Solutions

```cpp

class Solution{
	public:
    int minJump(int n,vector<int> arr)
    {
        //code here
        int res = 0, last = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if(arr[i] % 2 == 0 || arr[i] % 3 == 0) {
                res = max(res, i - last);
                last = i;
            }
        }
        return res;
        
    }
};

```
